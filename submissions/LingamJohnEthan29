My name is John 

I am a studying Computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in full stack development 

The open source project I admire is Shadcn UI which is a great source for frontend components and it saved me a lot of trouble while designing frontend components

I hope to complete a lot of projects in full stack development so that I can gain more experience in the field.
